Books is compatible with any barcode scanner that emulates a keyboard. If      	you're looking for a solid but cheap scanner, we highly recommend looking for a       	<a href="#">neutered Cue:Cat</a> online at places like eBay. To use these kinds of scanners,       	click the <tt>ISBN</tt> field and scan the barcode. Books will convert UPC barcodes to ISBN      	numbers as required, so all you need to do is click the <tt>Quickfill</tt> button after      	scanning.</p>      	      <p>If you have an iSight camera and would like to use it, click the camera lookup icon next to the       	<tt>ISBN</tt> field to bring up the camera window.</p>      	  <p align="center"><img src="../screenshots/isight-icon.png" border="1" /><br />      	Camera Lookup Icon</p>      	      	<p>[Describe camera operation]</p>      		  <div id="taskbox">        <h2>Did You Know?</h2>        <p>The camera scanning feature is designed to work with Apple's iSight cameras, but it is         compatible with other Firewire video cameras, such as portable home video recorders. If you        have such a camera and would like to use it with Books, the instructions above still apply.         We can't guarantee that it will work perfectly, but it might work better than you expect.</p>    </div>  </div></body></html>
