The entire application has been overhauled         both graphically and functionally. The changes within Books 3 were necessary to support        larger collections, provide better support for retrieving book information online, and        to improve the performance of the application.</p>      <p>When you begin Books for the first time, you will be greeted with a dialog asking whether         you would like to have Books search for new versions on startup. This is used to keep         users up-to-date and this will both notify you about new versions and install them - all        without you needing to visit any websites. If you decide to not use this feature, none        of the Books features will be disable or otherwise adversely affected.</p>	  <p><img src="../screenshots/auto_updates.jpg" alt="" border="2" /></p>	  <p>To import your Books data from Books 2, on start-up, select the Import menu from the File 	    menu. Contained within is an item labeled "Books 2.0 Importer". Select this to launch the 	    data importer. You will be prompted for the location of your Books 2 data (this file ends	    in a .books extension), so have that ready. After the importer finishes, your book 	    information will be available in a new list containing your records. You may now 	    reorganize these as you see fit within the new application.</p>	  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Earlier versions of Books saved cover images using sizes much smaller	    than the current version. Consequently, your imported covers may appear to be quite small. 	    You can replace these covers by using the "Quickfill" button on the book information window	    to find larger covers online.</p>  </div></body></html>
